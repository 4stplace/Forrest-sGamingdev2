## LockedIn pitch document
for my game that I'm making on my own, I am making an escape-room type game. in the game, you are looking for the key of your very cluttered house.
in fact, the house is so cluttered, that you have to try to move things out of the way.
the challenge of the game is finding your way through the clutter. you may need to move things out of the way, and the way to do that is using the random items you find around the house in ridiculous ways.
